# Project Overview

he Freebies Ecommerce Flutter App is a dynamic mobile application that redefines the freebies experience. Offering a wide array of free products sourced from a mock RESTful API (using Platzi API), the app seamlessly integrates user authentication, real-time product retrieval, and cloud-based storage. Users can explore the latest freebies, manage their carts, create wishlists, and stay informed about upcoming promotions.

# Key Features

 # User Authentication
Empower users with a personalized experience by enabling account creation and authentication.
 Users can securely log in to access additional features and customize their preferences.

 # Latest News and Products
Stay updated with the latest freebies and news sourced from the Platzi API. The app dynamically fetches and displays real-time information, ensuring users are informed about new opportunities.

 # RESTful API Integration
Harness the power of a RESTful API to retrieve product details, images, and news seamlessly. The app communicates with the Platzi API to provide an extensive catalog of freebies for users to explore.

 # Firebase Cloud Firestore
Utilize Firebase Cloud Firestore to store and manage user data, preferences, and cart/wishlist contents. This ensures a reliable and scalable backend for the app's essential functionalities.

 # Firebase Cloud Storage
Leverage Firebase Cloud Storage to store and retrieve product images efficiently. This cloud-based solution ensures quick access to high-quality images, enhancing the visual appeal of the app.

 # Cart Management
Enable users to add desired freebies to their carts, review selected items, and proceed with easy checkout. The app ensures a smooth and intuitive cart management experience.
